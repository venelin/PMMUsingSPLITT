Description: Implementation of the log-likelihood calculation of the univariate 
    phylogenetic mixed model (PMM) using parallel tree traversal. The PMM is  
    used for comparative analysis of biological data originating from a set of 
    living and/or extinct species to estimate the rate of phenotypic evolution 
    resulting from genetic drift. The calculation of the log-likelihood of the 
    model parameters, given a phylogenetic tree and trait data at the tips, is
    done using a quadratic polynomial representation of the log-likelihood 
    function described in the article "Parallel Likelihood Calculation for 
    Phylogenetic Comparative Models: the 'SPLITT' C++ Library". A preprint of 
    the article is available from 
    <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/10/29/235739>. 
    The package provides an implementation in R (function 'PMMLogLik') as well 
    as a parallel implementation in C++ (function 'PMMLogLikCpp') based 
    on the 'SPLITT' library for serial and parallel lineage traversal of trees 
    (<https://venelin.github.io/SPLITT/index.html>). The function 'MiniBenchmark'
    allows to compare the calculation times for different tree sizes.
