# PMMUsingSPLITT

The goal of PMMUsingSPLITT is to provide a minimal example of how to use the SPLITT C++ library in an R-package. The package implements parallelized log-likelihood calculation of the univariate phylogenetic mixed model (PMM). The PMM is used in the comparative analysis of biological data originating from a set of living and/or extinct species to estimate the rate of phenotypic evolution resulting from genetic drift. The calculation of the log-likelihood of the model parameters, given a phylogenetic tree and trait data at the tips, is done using a quadratic polynomial representation of the log-likelihood function described in the article 'Parallel Likelihood Calculation for Phylogenetic Comparative Models: the 'SPLITT' C++ Library'. A preprint of the article is available from https://doi.org/10.1101/235739. The package provides an implementation in R (function 'PMMLogLik') as well as a parallel implementation in C++ (function 'PMMLogLikCpp') based on the 'SPLITT' library for serial and parallel lineage traversal of trees (https://venelin.github.io/SPLITT/index.html). The function 'MiniBenchmark' allows to compare the calculation times for different tree sizes.  See [this guide](https://venelin.github.io/SPLITT/articles/SPLITTRcppModules.html) for a tutorial. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of PMMUsingSPLITT from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("PMMUsingSPLITT")
```

## Examples

* Calculating the likelihood of the PMM for a given tree, data and model parameters.
```{r}
library(ape)
library(PMMUsingSPLITT)

set.seed(10)

N <- 1000
x0 <- 0.1
alpha <- 1
theta <- 10
sigma2 <- 0.25
sigmae2 <- 1

tree <- rtree(N)

g <- rTraitCont(tree, model = "OU", root.value = x0,
                alpha = alpha, sigma = sqrt(sigma2),
                ancestor = FALSE)

x <- g + rnorm(n = N, mean = 0, sd = sqrt(sigmae2))

cat("logLikelihood using R:", PMMLogLik(x, tree, x0, sigma2, sigmae2), "\n")
cat("logLikelihood using R:", PMMLogLikCpp(x, tree, x0, sigma2, sigmae2), "\n")
```

* Performing a benchmark to measure the likelihood calculation times using different parallelization strategies:

```{r}
# N specifies the size of the phylogenetic tree. 
# Ntests specifies the number of executions in one time measurement 
# (the more the better, but also slower).
MiniBenchmark(N = 100, Ntests = 100)
MiniBenchmark(N = 1000, Ntests = 10)
MiniBenchmark(N = 10000, Ntests = 10)
```
